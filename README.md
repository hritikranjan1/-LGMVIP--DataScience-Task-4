# Image to Pencil Sketch Converter

## Author
**Hritik Ranjan**

## Project Overview
This project converts images to pencil sketches using Python's OpenCV library. The technique involves converting an image to grayscale, inverting it, applying Gaussian blur, and then combining these images to produce a sketch effect.

## Introduction
Image processing is a fascinating field that involves modifying or analyzing images to extract useful information or create artistic effects. This project focuses on transforming a regular image into a pencil sketch using simple image processing techniques. 

## Features
- Convert any image into a pencil sketch.
- Visualize both the original image and the sketch side by side.
- Easy to use with just a few lines of code.

## Installation
To run this project, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below to install the required libraries:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-to-pencil-sketch.git
   cd image-to-pencil-sketch
2.Install the necessary libraries using pip:

    pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

## Usage

Follow these steps to convert an image into a pencil sketch:

   Download or select an image that you want to convert into a sketch.
    Update the image path in the script:
        Open the image_to_sketch.py file.
        Change the image_path variable to point to your image file. For example:

        python

    image_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'  # Change this to your image path

## Run the script:

    python image_to_sketch.py
## Code Explanation

Here's a breakdown of the code:

python

    import cv2
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    def image_to_sketch(image_path):
     # Read the image
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    
    # Convert the image to grayscale
    gray_img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Invert the grayscale image
    inverted_gray_img = 255 - gray_img

    # Apply Gaussian blur
    blurred_img = cv2.GaussianBlur(inverted_gray_img, (21, 21), 0)

    # Invert the blurred image
    inverted_blurred_img = 255 - blurred_img

    # Create the pencil sketch image by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurred image
    sketch_img = cv2.divide(gray_img, inverted_blurred_img, scale=256)

    return sketch_img

    def display_images(original, sketch):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))

    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    plt.title("Original Image")
    plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(original, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
    plt.axis('off')

    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    plt.title("Pencil Sketch")
    plt.imshow(sketch, cmap='gray')
    plt.axis('off')

    plt.show()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
    image_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'  # Change this to your image path
    original_image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    sketch_image = image_to_sketch(image_path)

    display_images(original_image, sketch_image)

    Libraries:
        cv2: Used for image processing tasks.
        numpy: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
        matplotlib.pyplot: Used for displaying images.

    Functions:
        image_to_sketch(image_path): Converts the given image to a pencil sketch.
        display_images(original, sketch): Displays the original and sketch images side by side.

## How It Works
   Image Reading: The input image is read using OpenCV.
    Grayscale Conversion: The image is converted to grayscale, which simplifies the sketching process.
    Inversion: The grayscale image is inverted to enhance the sketch effect.
    Gaussian Blur: The inverted image is blurred using a Gaussian filter, which helps in creating the sketch effect.
    Final Sketch Creation: The pencil sketch is generated by combining the grayscale and inverted blurred images using a division operation.
    Visualization: Both the original and sketch images are displayed using Matplotlib.

Results

When you run the script with an image, you will see two images: the original image on the left and the pencil sketch on the right. Below is a sample output you can expect:
